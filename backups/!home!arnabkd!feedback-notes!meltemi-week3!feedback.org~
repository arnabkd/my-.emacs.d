* Meltemi week 3 qch file feedback
** Mail from Nick (for own reference)
Testing for week 3 Meltemi qch file release:
 
Download the Meltemi snapshot from the following location and install it in the Meltemi SDK (Application SDK if you can find it).
http://builder.europe.nokia.com:8080/job/External_latest_qch_to_staging/ws/meltemi-external.qch
 
Not following links do not work:
-          Frameset link on first page
-          Feedback and Bluetooth API links
 
Content:
-          Browse through the documentation, although you do not need to look at every page
 
Look for odd characters, pages not rendering, odd layouts, anything that seems unintended
 
F1 Help
Import some of the projects from Casper, I think you should be able to use his example package:
Please ask him for the location.
 
Open the examples, and test the F1 functionality for the classes
Index:
Go to the help system and see if the Class names appear properly in the index table
Check to see if the Bookmark function works
Test with some terms from the doc what happens when you search for class names, and other terms.
Please be prepared to present some initial conclusions in the team meeting tomorrow at 9.00 Oslo time, if you are there.
In addition, I would like to use your report as a basis for a release note on Friday, so please write down what you find.
Note: This is a functional test of the qch file, not so much a check of the content.

** Pages that are not being rendered
 + qml.html files in QML graphics example
 + missing links to sourcecode in the "About this guide" section
 + missing links to the guide in other formats (pdf, ebook etc)

** Getting started - linking problems
After I start coding in the "Getting Started & Prototyping the Application" section, I don't see a link to the next page. Hopefully this will be added soon.
 
** Bookmarking
Bookmarking seems to work fine.  

** Searching
Searching seems to work properly, and I can search my way back to specific pages inside the meltemi week 3 help thing.

However, the search result I'm looking for might be too far down the list. Example : "getting started with meltemi" gives us 22 hits. But the link I actually want is #3 from the top, and the #2 link is actually just a page that contains the words "getting" and "started" in a whole another context. I realize that this isn't an issue with the .qch file itself, but this is still an issue that should get some attention.

** Problematic cases
While browsing, you have for instance "Home > Guide > Fundamentals > ..". Only the "Home" link is clickable, which seems quite awkward to me.  I don't understand (as a user) why certain parts of the path are clickable while others are not. 

Sometimes, the back button in creator does not work properly. I don't think this is a bug with creator. An example of this :
Go to Home/Guide/Tutorial/About this guide
Click on the (broken) link for the guide in PDF format. Now you can't press "Back" to get back to the "About" page. 

When not in fullscreen mode, the contents of the navigation bar can exceed the image background for the navigation bar, and this looks really ugly.
